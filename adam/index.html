Sure, here is a simple HTML page that references the files `ego_impacts.html`, `Facebook_impacts.html`, and `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My HTML Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>

<header>
  <h1>My HTML Page</h1>
</header>

<main>

  <a href="ego_impacts.html">Ego Impacts</a>
  <a href="Facebook_impacts.html">Facebook Impacts</a>
  <a href="index.html">Index</a>

</main>

<footer>
  <p>Copyright &copy; 2023 Bard</p>
</footer>

</body>
</html>
```

This HTML page will create a simple web page with three links: one to each of the three files that you specified. The links will be displayed on the main page of the website, and when a user clicks on one of the links, they will be taken to the corresponding file.

You can customize the HTML page to your liking, such as by adding additional content, changing the style of the page, or adding images. You can also add additional links to other files or websites.
